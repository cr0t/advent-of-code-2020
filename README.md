# Advent of Code 2020 in Elixir

My humble solutions to the challenges from [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

You can run these example, if you have elixir installed. This is how you can run these scripts:

```
$ elixir day_01.exs                                                                                                      19:55:35
